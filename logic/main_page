	<h3>Our purpose</h3>

	<p>Traffic Flow-and-Go is a schedule builder designed to use 
	the recent development of hybrid work to reduce urban traffic
	congestion during the standard workweek.</p>

	<h3>The Problem</h3>

	<p>Since the quality of municipal transit systems varies from 
	city to city and the quality of these systems is often low,
	many workers are forced to drive if they want a somewhat
	reasonable commute time. This results in a greater amount of
	cars on the road at a given time and a greater chance of congestion.
	Traffic congestion is a problem that both reduces worker well-being
	and increases the amount of carbon a vehicle emits during a drive.</p>
	
	<h3>How This Works</h3>

	<p>Using a list of employees in a city, including their home location,
	work location, and their mandatory in-person workdays, this website finds
	an optimal balance of in-person and remote workdays for each worker. This
	balance is then entered into a schedule, that, if followed, will reduce
	overall traffic congestion. Employees can be added or removed from the list.
	Also, employee information in the list can be edited.</p>
