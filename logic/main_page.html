		<h3>Our purpose</h3>

		<p>Traffic Flow-and-Go is a schedule builder designed to use 
		the recent development of hybrid work to reduce urban traffic	
		congestion during the standard workweek</p>

		<h3>How This Works</h3>

		<p>Using a list of employees in a city, including their home location,
		work location, and their mandatory in-person workdays, this website finds
		an optimal balance of in-person and remote workdays for each worker. This
		balance is then entered into a schedule, that, if followed, will reduce
		overall traffic congestion. Employees can be added or removed from the list.
		Also, employee information in the list can be edited.</p>

		<h3>The Problem</h3>

		<p>Since the quality of municipal transit systems varies from 
		city to city and the quality of these systems is often low,
		many workers are forced to drive if they want a somewhat
		reasonable commute time. This results in a greater amount of
		cars on the road at a given time and a greater chance of congestion.
		Traffic congestion is a problem that both reduces worker well-being
		and increases the amount of carbon a vehicle emits during a drive.</p>
